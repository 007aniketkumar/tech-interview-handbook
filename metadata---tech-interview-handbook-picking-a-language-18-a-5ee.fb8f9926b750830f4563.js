Most companies will let you code in any language you want, the only exception I know being Google, where they only allow candidates to pick from Java, C++, JavaScript or Python for their algorithmic coding interviews. Most of the time, I would recommend that you use a language that you are extremely familiar with rather than picking up a new language just for doing interviews because the company uses that language heavily.","source":"/Users/yangshun/Developer/tech-interview-handbook/contents/picking-a-language.md","permalink":"/tech-interview-handbook/picking-a-language","sidebar":"docs","category":"Interview Process","subCategory":"Coding Round","next":"study-and-practice","previous":"coding-round-overview","previous_title":"Overview","next_title":"Study and Practice"}')}}]);
