Formats would differ slightly depending on the roles you are applying to. Many companies like to use [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/) for collaborative code editing. CoderPad supports running of the program, so you might be asked to fix your code such that it can be run. For front end interviews, many companies like to use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), and it will be worth your time to familiarize yourself with the user interfaces of such web-based coding environments.","source":"/Users/yangshun/Developer/tech-interview-handbook/contents/interview-stages.md","permalink":"/tech-interview-handbook/interview-stages"}')}}]);
