Formats would differ slightly depending on the roles you are applying to. Many companies like to use [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/) for collaborative code editing. CoderPad supports running of the program, so you might be asked to fix your code such that it can be run. For front end interviews, many companies like to use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), and it will be worth your time to familiarize yourself with the user interfaces of such web-based coding environments.","source":"/Users/yangshun/Developer/tech-interview-handbook/contents/interview-formats.md","permalink":"/tech-interview-handbook/interview-formats","sidebar":"docs","category":"Interview Process","next":"cheatsheet","previous":"self-introduction","previous_title":"Self Introduction","next_title":"Cheatsheet"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"## What is this?","source":"/Users/yangshun/Developer/tech-interview-handbook/contents/introduction.md","permalink":"/tech-interview-handbook/introduction","sidebar":"docs","category":"Preface","next":"resume","next_title":"Resume"},"cover-letter":{"id":"cover-letter","title":"Cover Letter","description":"- A short introduction describing who you are and what you\'re looking for.","source":"/Users/yangshun/Developer/tech-interview-handbook/contents/cover-letter.md","permalink":"/tech-interview-handbook/cover-letter","sidebar":"docs","category":"Job Application","next":"self-introduction","previous":"resume","previous_title":"Resume","next_title":"Self Introduction"},"psychological-tricks":{"id":"psychological-tricks","title":"Psychological Tricks","description":"Here are some psychological tricks that will help you ace a job interview.","source":"/Users/yangshun/Developer/tech-interview-handbook/contents/psychological-tricks.md","permalink":"/tech-interview-handbook/psychological-tricks","sidebar":"docs","category":"Interview Process","next":"questions-to-ask","previous":"cheatsheet","previous_title":"Cheatsheet","next_title":"Questions To Ask"},"negotiation":{"id":"negotiation","title":"Negotiation","description":"## Ten Rules of Negotiation","source":"/Users/yangshun/Developer/tech-interview-handbook/contents/negotiation.md","permalink":"/tech-interview-handbook/negotiation","sidebar":"docs","category":"Interview Process","next":"algorithms/array","previous":"questions-to-ask","previous_title":"Questions To Ask","next_title":"Array"},"questions-to-ask":{"id":"questions-to-ask","title":"Questions To Ask","description":"Here are some good questions to ask at the end of the interview, extracted from various sources.
